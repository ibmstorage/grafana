// Package metrics defines the Recorder interface nanogit uses to report
// protocol/network-level instrumentation and the context plumbing to inject
// an implementation. Attach a recorder with ToContext; nanogit retrieves it
// with FromContext and falls back to a NoopRecorder when none is set.
//
//	ctx := metrics.ToContext(context.Background(), myRecorder)
//	client, err := nanogit.NewHTTPClient(repo, opts...)
//	ref, err := client.GetRef(ctx, "refs/heads/main")
//
// nanogit does not depend on any particular metrics backend (Prometheus,
// OpenTelemetry, etc.). Callers implement Recorder and bridge its calls to
// whichever backend they already use, the same way they bridge log.Logger —
// see the ExampleToContext function in this package for a minimal adapter,
// and https://grafana.github.io/nanogit/architecture/metrics for a full
// guide with Prometheus and OpenTelemetry bridges.

// Recorder receives protocol/network-level instrumentation samples emitted
// by nanogit's HTTP and packfile-fetch layers. Implementations decide how to
// aggregate and export these samples (e.g. as Prometheus or OpenTelemetry
// metrics); nanogit only reports raw values.
//
// Each method takes a single sample struct rather than positional arguments,
// so nanogit can add fields to a sample in a future minor version without
// breaking existing Recorder implementations — the same reason
// log/slog.Handler takes a slog.Record instead of a parameter list.
// Unrecognized fields should be ignored by implementations, not treated as
// exhaustive.
//
// ctx is the context of the nanogit operation that triggered the sample. It
// is provided so implementations can attach trace-correlated exemplars (as
// OpenTelemetry's metric API requires) or read request-scoped values; it is
// not a signal to cancel or delay work. Recorder methods are called inline
// on the request path and must return promptly.
//
// A Client is safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines, and the same
// Recorder can be shared across all of them via one context (or reused
// across multiple contexts); implementations must therefore be safe for
// concurrent calls.

	//     which nanogit's caller reads after the headers arrive and which
	//     is often the slowest part of the operation; that read time is
	//     included.
	//   - For receive-pack (push), the packfile is the request body, which
	//     the HTTP client streams to the server before returning the
	//     response headers, so its upload time is included as well.
	// For an attempt that failed before any response (a network error) or
